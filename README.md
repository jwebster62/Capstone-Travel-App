# Capstone Travel App

This is my entry for the 5th and final project in Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree, The Capstone Travel App.

# Goals
* Make a request using the API through OpenWeatherApp to get the location's temperature utilizing user's zip code input.
* Post user generated data using the zip code and "feelings" input with a dynamically generated date.
* Get data from server and update the UI
